    "When a company pays dividends or does a stock split, the raw closing price on any given date can look very different from what you’d expect if you’re measuring the true performance of holding that stock. The “Adj Close” (adjusted close) is a version of the closing price that has been retroactively adjusted to reflect these corporate actions, so that historical prices are consistent over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s why it matters:\n",
    "1. Dividends: If a stock pays a dividend, part of the company’s value is effectively handed back to shareholders as cash.\n",
    "\t- The next day, you might see the stock price drop roughly by the dividend amount.\n",
    "\t- The raw close might show a drop, but if you were holding the stock, you received that dividend, so your total return is not just the drop in price.\n",
    "2.\tStock Splits: When a company splits its stock (e.g., 2-for-1 split), the number of shares doubles and the price roughly halves.\n",
    "\t- If you look at the raw historical price before the split, it may appear artificially high compared to after the split.\n",
    "\t- The adjusted close will factor in the split so that the price history is on a comparable scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "By adjusting historical prices for these events, the “Adj Close” series reflects the true value of holding the stock over time, including reinvested dividends and after accounting for splits. This is crucial for calculating accurate returns.\n",
    "- If you ignore splits and dividends (using the raw “Close”), you might see big “jumps” or “drops” on certain days that don’t truly represent gains or losses for a long-term holder.\n",
    "- If you use “Adj Close,” your time series is smoothed out to reflect a consistent basis for return calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "In older versions of yfinance, you’d see both \"Close\" and \"Adj Close\" columns side by side. With the newer default setting (auto_adjust=True), you get a single \"Close\" column where the data is already adjusted for splits and dividends under the hood. That’s why you might not see \"Adj Close\" anymore—it’s effectively built into \"Close\"."

    "### 1. CAPM Formula\n",
    "\n",
    "Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) states that the expected return  E(R_i)  of a stock (or asset)  i  is:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$E(R_i)\n",
    "= R_f\n",
    "\t•\t\\beta_i \\, \\bigl( E(R_m) - R_f \\bigr),$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- $R_f$  = Risk-free rate (e.g., return on short-term Treasury bills).\n",
    "- $E(R_m)$  = Expected return of the market (often proxied by a broad index like the S&P 500).\n",
    "- $\\beta_i$ = the beta of the stock i. It measures how sensitive R_i is to R_m.\n",
    "- $E(R_m) - R_f$  is the market risk premium (the extra return investors expect over the risk-free rate).\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpretation: If a stock is riskier than the overall market (i.e., $\\beta$ > 1), then its expected return should be higher than the market’s. If it’s less volatile than the market ($\\beta$ < 1), investors expect a lower return than the market as compensation for less risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Where the Formula Comes From (Intuitive Explanation)\n",
    "1.\tInvestors Need Compensation for Time & Risk\n",
    "\t- They can always earn $R_f$ by investing in “safe” government bonds (theoretically risk-free).\n",
    "\t- If an asset is riskier, investors demand a premium above $R_f$.\n",
    "2.\tOne-Factor Model\n",
    "\t- CAPM assumes that the main source of systematic **(non-diversifiable)** risk is the entire market’s fluctuation.\n",
    "\t- Hence, we only need one factor: the market return.\n",
    "\t- The size of that exposure to the market’s ups and downs is what $\\beta$ measures.\n",
    "3. Market Risk Premium\n",
    "\t- The difference $E(R_m) - R_f$ is how much more the market is expected to return above the risk-free rate.\n",
    "\t- Each stock’s expected return scales with this market risk premium based on $\\beta$.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Why $\\beta$ Is Central in CAPM\n",
    "1.\tMeasure of Systematic Risk:\n",
    "$\\beta$ captures the part of the stock’s movement that cannot be eliminated by diversification.\n",
    "\t- For instance, if the market tanks, a high-$\\beta$ stock typically falls even more.\n",
    "\t- Low-$\\beta$ stocks move less than the market but still move in the same general direction.\n",
    "2.\tDetermines Required Return:\n",
    "\t- In the CAPM view, the only risk investors need compensation for is systematic risk (market risk), measured by $\\beta$.\n",
    "\t- Idiosyncratic (firm-specific) risk can be **diversified away**, so CAPM does not reward that kind of risk.\n",
    "3.\tSlope in Regression:\n",
    "\t- Empirically, $\\beta$ is often found by regressing the stock’s returns on the market’s returns, i.e.\n",
    "\n",
    "        $$R_{\\text{stock}} = \\alpha + \\beta \\, R_{\\text{market}} + \\varepsilon.$$\n",
    "    -  The slope $\\beta$ tells you how many percentage points the stock typically moves for each 1% move in the market.\n",
    "4. Example:\n",
    "\t-  If $\\beta$ = 1.2, when the market is up 1%, we’d expect the stock to be up about 1.2%. If the market is down 1%, the stock might be down 1.2% (on average).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Putting It All Together\n",
    "\n",
    "- CAPM says a stock’s expected return is risk-free return plus a premium for taking on market risk.\n",
    "- $\\beta$ is how you quantify how much market risk the stock carries.\n",
    "- $\\beta > 1$: more volatile than the market, thus higher expected return.\n",
    "- $\\beta < 1$: less volatile, so lower expected return.\n",
    "- If $\\beta = 0$, the stock’s expected return equals the risk-free rate (no market exposure).\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, $\\beta$ is the heart of CAPM: it’s the scaling factor that turns the market’s risk premium into the stock’s expected risk premium. Investors in a high-beta stock expect higher returns as compensation for higher systematic risk."
