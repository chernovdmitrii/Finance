Here’s a cool README.md file for your GitHub repository, incorporating your Coursera course and Python applications:

📈 Financial Markets with Python 🐍

🚀 This repository contains my hands-on applications of financial market theories in Python. Inspired by the “Financial Markets” course on Coursera, I have implemented key financial models, including:
	•	📊 Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT)
	•	📈 Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)
	•	📉 Gordon Growth Model (GGM)
	•	📌 Post-Modern Portfolio Theory (PMPT)

🏦 About This Project

This project is designed to bridge the gap between financial theory and practical implementation. Each notebook contains well-documented code, real-world financial datasets, and visualization techniques to help analyze and optimize investment strategies.
