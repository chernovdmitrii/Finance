## Overview
This repository demonstrates how to apply some of the most fundamental concepts from modern finance using Python. Each Jupyter Notebook explores a different area, showcasing:
- Mathematical derivations
- Implementation in Python
- Visualization and interpretation of results

By walking through these notebooks, you can gain a solid understanding of how theoretical models translate into actionable insights.

## Project Structure

### 1. CAPM.ipynb
**Focus:** The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)  
**Key Topics:**
- Understanding systematic vs. unsystematic risk  
- Deriving the Security Market Line (SML)  
- Estimating beta and interpreting alpha in real-world data

### 2. GGM.ipynb
**Focus:** Gordon Growth Model (GGM)  
**Key Topics:**
- Valuation of stocks using dividend growth assumptions  
- Sensitivity analysis with changing growth rates  
- Practical examples of applying GGM to real stocks

### 3. MPT.ipynb
**Focus:** Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT)  
**Key Topics:**
- Constructing the efficient frontier  
- Diversification benefits and correlation analysis  
- Risk-return optimization with Python’s data libraries

### 4. PMPT.ipynb
**Focus:** Post-Modern Portfolio Theory (PMPT)  
**Key Topics:**
- Introducing downside risk measures (e.g., semi-deviation, Value at Risk)  
- Comparing PMPT vs. MPT in terms of real-world applicability  
- Portfolio optimization with advanced risk metrics

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/financial-markets-python.git
   cd financial-markets-python
   ```
2. **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # On Windows: env\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. **Install the required packages**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   
   > *If `requirements.txt` is not included, simply install the libraries used in the notebooks (e.g., `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `scipy`, etc.).*
